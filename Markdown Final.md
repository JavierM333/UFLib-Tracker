## Ideas for Final Projects
* Wrapper for UF library crowd levels
* Notebook to track your watched shows/movies
* App for social credit (Nosedive - Black Mirror Episode)

### Top Choices
1. Wrapper for UF library crowd levels
2. Movie notebook
<sup>App for social credit favorite but complicated</sup>

### UF Crowds App Evaluation
* **Mobile**: How unique is this
-- Unique since it's specific to UF and you can customize notifications and other specifics.
-- will use location, push, and real-time
* **Story**: compelling story once project done
-- This would be useful to UF students since they can use it on the daily to know which library is best to go to
-- very well, it has an actual use, the standard occupancy data provided by UF is basic
* **Market**: How big is the market for this?
-- Small, only the size of UF. as long as other colleges have similar API access, it can be reusable through same functions.
-- it's for a niche group of people
-- very well defined audience, UF students
* **Habit**: How habit-forming/addicting is it?
-- Not at all, it's utility not addicting so use as often as they want to study on campus
-- Users will consume the app instead of create
* **Scope**: How well formed is the scope of app?
-- Not technical at all, it's mostly customizing already available information. This would let me create notifications, when closed, when not busy using thresholds, filtering by how busy. It's intended to make a more useful access to library info.
-- A stripped version of this app is still useful but doesn't make it too unique.
-- this app is clearly defined

### Movie Notebook App Evaluation
* **Category**: Journaling/Entertainment
* **Mobile**: Can be used offline and it's private
* **Story**: don't want to have a service that is public, can be stored locally and is like journaling off of movies, more private
* **Habit**: Can be habit forming depending on how often they watch shows and movies. helpful to remember how they felt during the movie/show and what they thought of it.
* **Scope**: Intended for an audience that wants a private way to express how they felt about a movie/show that isn't stored online, avoid sold data or private thoughts being exposed.
